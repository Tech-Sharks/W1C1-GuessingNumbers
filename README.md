## Guess the Number Game

### Overview
Guess the Number Game is a simple console-based game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number within a certain range. It's a great project to practice basic Java concepts like conditional statements, loops, and user input.

### Instructions
1. The program generates a random number between a specified range.
2. The player is prompted to enter their guess.
3. If the guess is correct, the player wins the game.
4. If the guess is incorrect, the program provides feedback to help the player guess correctly (e.g., "Too high" or "Too low").
5. The player continues guessing until they guess the correct number.
6. After winning the game, the player is shown the number of attempts it took to guess correctly.

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
- A Java IDE or a text editor to write and run the code (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ, or Visual Studio Code).

### Getting Started
1. Clone the repository or download the source code files to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your Java IDE or text editor.

### Usage
1. Compile and run the `GuessTheNumberGame.java` file.
2. Follow the instructions displayed in the console to play the game.
3. Enter your guess and press Enter.
4. If your guess is incorrect, the program will provide feedback, and you can make another guess.
5. Continue guessing until you guess the correct number.
6. After winning, the program will display the number of attempts it took to guess correctly.
7. To play again, restart the program.

### Example
```
Welcome to Guess the Number Game!
I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.
Can you guess the number?

Enter your guess: 50
Too low! Try again.

Enter your guess: 75
Too high! Try again.

Enter your guess: 65
Too low! Try again.

Enter your guess: 70
Congratulations! You guessed the number in 4 attempts.
```

### Customization
Feel free to customize the game to add your own creative features or modify the existing ones. Here are a few ideas:
- Allow the player to choose the range of numbers. (+1 point)
- Implement a scoring system based on the number of attempts. (+5 points)
- Add a time limit for each guess. (+5 points)
- Create a leaderboard to keep track of the best scores. (+10 points)

### Housekeeping
- Good coding practices (+15 points)
